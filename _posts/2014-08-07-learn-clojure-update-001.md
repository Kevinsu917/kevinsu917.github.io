Just about a week into [Learn the Shit out of Clojure Month](/2014/08/01/learn-the-sht-out-of-clojure/), and I've gotten through chapters 1-3 of [Programming Clojure](http://pragprog.com/book/shcloj/programming-clojure). I made notes as I was going through the chapters. This is not meant to be a review of the book or a review of the material. Merely how I related to the material. What clicked. What didn't.
